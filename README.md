# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin project using HTML along with what I've learned with Git and the command terminal.
I am also learning vim and starting to use the shortcuts which has been challenging.
So far, I'm very impressed with the many vim commands that you can use to make your coding life easier.
It will take time and practice to remember to use the vim commands and to get accustomed to what you can do with vim while I'm learning new coding concepts...
While it seems like a lot right now to learn vim while I'm learning different commands and concepts for Git, CLI, and HTML, my hope is that this upfront work will pay off over time.
Regarding the project recipes, the recipes featured are some of my favorite food items to eat or make. 
You'll be able to make these featured recipes your own, customizing with the ingredients you have on hand or whatever ingredients you like.
That's how I view cooking and recipes; following the recipe exactly is just one way to do things, while there are always substitutions you can make to make the recipe your own.
Enjoy the recipes!
