# odin-recipes
## Introduction & Background
This is my first Odin project using HTML, along with what I've learned on Git and the command terminal.
I am also learning to use vim.

While it seems like a lot right now to learn vim while learning new concepts such as Git, CLI, and HTML, my hope is that this upfront work will pay off over time.

## About The Recipes 
The recipes featured are some of my favorite food items to eat or make.
I've written the recipes to be customizable, as I often swap out ingredients in these recipes based on what I'm craving or what I have on hand. 
As such, you'll be able to make these featured recipes your own, customizing with ingredients you have on hand or whatever ingredients you prefer.

The way I see it, a recipe is just one way to do things, whereas there are many other paths to get to a similarly delicious outcome.
I encourage you to take inspiration from these recipes and tweak them to cook up your own culinary creation. 
Enjoy the recipes!
