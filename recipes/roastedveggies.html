    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a healthy and easy way to use up a variety of vegetables you have in the fridge. Vegetable options include carrots, zucchini, sweet potatoes, onions, bell peppers, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, squash, or broccoli.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>your choice of veggies, chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>your choice of additional seasonings, such as smoked paprika, garlic powder, or cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>one lemon</li>
        <li>salt, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon depending on your taste</li>
        <li>pepper, 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon depending on your taste</li>
        <li>avocado oil - since the oven temperature will be 400 degrees</li>
        <li>chopped parsley, basil or cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees and take out your sheet pan. If using parchment paper, line your sheet pan with it.</li>
        <li>Prepare and chop your choices of vegetables into bite-sized pieces. For more delicate vegetables like zucchini and bell peppers, I like to cut them into bigger pieces as they cook faster than root vegetables like sweet potatoes and carrots.</li>
        <li>Put your chopped veggies onto the sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Drizzle avocado oil over the veggies. It's okay if the oil doesn't cover everything because you will be mixing everything altogether with your hands or with a spatula later.</li>
        <li>Cut your lemon in half and squeeze one or both of the halves over the sheet pan, depending on how much acidity you'd like.</li>
        <li>Add your salt, pepper, and choice of seasonings based on your preferences</li>
        <li>Using your hands or a spatula, mix everything on the pan so that the avocado oil and seasonings cover the veggies evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While waiting, you can chop up parsley, basil or cilantro to sprinkle on the roasted veggies when out of the oven.</li>
    </ul>
